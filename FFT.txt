Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

- An algorithm that computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a discrete-time signal
- The output of the DFT is a sequence of complex numbers that represent the frequency components of the original signal
- These frequency components are represented as the magnitudes and phases of sinusoidal waves at different frequencies that, when combined, reconstruct the original signal.


Implementation

Data Collection: 
- Collect gyro data over a constant, pre-defined sampling period/frequency. 

Preprocessing (denoise/increase the SNR):
- Windowing: Apply a window function to minimize *spectral leakage. Common window functions include Hanning, Hamming, Blackman, and Gaussian. This step helps to reduce artifacts in the frequency domain.

FFT Calculation: 
- Apply the FFT algorithm to the preprocessed gyro data. The FFT algorithm will compute the frequency components present in the signal. The output will be a set of complex numbers representing the magnitude and phase of each frequency component.

Post-processing:
- Frequency Binning: Once you have the FFT output, you can map the frequency components to their corresponding frequency bins. Each bin represents a specific range of frequencies.
- Magnitude Calculation: Calculate the magnitude of each frequency component from the complex FFT output. This magnitude represents the strength or amplitude of each frequency component in the signal.
- Frequency Domain Analysis: Analyze the frequency domain data to identify our frequencies of interest. You can use techniques such as spectral analysis, peak detection, or filtering to extract relevant information.
- Visualization and Interpretation (optional): Visualize the frequency spectrum and interpret the results. You can plot the magnitude spectrum to visualize the frequency content of the gyro data. 
Interpret the peaks in the spectrum to understand the dominant frequencies and any periodic patterns present in the data.

*Spectral leakage occurs because the frequency components of the signal may not align perfectly with the frequency bins of the FFT. 
As a result, energy from the signal leaks into adjacent frequency bins, leading to smearing or spreading of energy across the frequency spectrum. 
This can obscure or distort the true frequency content of the signal, particularly for frequency components that are not integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.
